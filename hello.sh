2.  **Run the script**:
    *   You can run the script using one of the following methods:
        *   **Relative path**: `./script.sh` (if you're in the same directory as the script)
        *   **Absolute path**: `/path/to/script.sh`
        *   **Source the script**: `source script.sh` or `. script.sh` (this runs the script in the current shell session)

**Example:**

Let's say you have a script called `hello.sh` with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
